IPL Data Analysis and Reporting Pipeline
• Developed an ETL pipeline to analyze IPL data from ball-by-ball and match datasets stored in S3.
• Utilized AWS Glue to process and transform data according to requirements such as identifying most
sixes, fours, most wickets, and fastest centuries for each season.
• Automated the generation of season-wise analysis reports and stored the processed data in S3 with
filenames corresponding to the respective season years.
• Streamlined the data analysis process, enabling efficient and scalable insights into IPL performance
metrics.
